- Languages and Libraries Used:
  - Languages: Python (Back-End), HTML (Front-End), CSS (Front-End), JavaScript (Front-End), SQL (Database)
  - Libraries/Technologies:
    - **Flask** is a Back-End framework in Python that allows us to route our users to the appropriate pages and also allows us too smoothly connect our front-end and back-end
    - **BootStrap** is a Front-End framework that allows us to create dynamic and responsive webpages and UI.
    - **AWS RDS** is a cloud database. This allows us to access our data from anywhere across the glove regardless of the device.
    - **OpenAI/ChatGPT** is the API we used to implement our AI chat assistant.
